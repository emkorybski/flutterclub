"_CORE_TERMS_OF_SERVICE";"<ol><li>This website www.flutterclub.com (the "Site") and the virtual betting game (the "Game") are operated and controlled by Social Gaming Ventures Limited (also referred to in these terms and conditions as "SGV", "we" and "us"). The contractual relationship is between the registered user and SGV and is governed by these Terms and Conditions, the Game Rules and the Virtual Betting Rules. By registering with the Site and participating in the Game you indicate your full acceptance and understanding of the following Terms and Conditions and the Virtual Betting Rules and the Game Rules, which are contained at this link.</li><li>It is your responsibility that you comply completely with your own local, national or state laws concerning betting prior to registering with the Site or participating in the Game. In particular, if you live in a country where Internet gambling is prohibited, you must not register with us, attempt to participate in the Game, other than on a free to play basis or use your payment card or other payment method to participate in the Game.</li><li>All disputes arising out of or in any way relating to this Site shall be governed by the laws of Ireland and the Irish Courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction for the purpose of any such proceedings arising out of or in any way relating to your use of the Site.</li><li>You must be over 18 to register with the Site or to play the Game. SGV reserves the right to request proof of age documentation from any customer at any time.</li><li>Each customer will choose their own username and password. These should be kept confidential by you. You agree to inform us at once by email or telephone if you believe that your account information is being misused by a third party so that we may terminate your account. Our contact details are set out on the 'contact' page of the Site.</li><li>It is your responsibility to ensure that all personal details are current and up to date.</li><li>It is your responsibility to ensure that all the details of virtual bets placed as part of the Game are correct. Once the transaction has been confirmed virtual bets placed cannot be cancelled.</li><li>All virtual bets placed as part of the Game are virtual only and don't give rise to any entitlement to real money should the virtual bet prove to be successful.</li><li>Virtual bets placed as part of the Game are accepted up to the off-time of an event or a pre-determined time whichever is the earlier. However, for some sporting events, SGV may allow a grace period during which virtual bets will be accepted but reserve the right to void any or all virtual bets should we think there has been a significant development in the event. SGV reserves the right to void any virtual bet inadvertently accepted after the acceptance of virtual bets has closed or where the event was resolved or at a stage where the customer could have any indication of the outcome.</li><li>In the event of there being a dispute over the time at which a virtual bet was placed as part of the Game then the time at which it was recorded on the transactional log will govern the settlement.</li><li>We cannot allow for mistakes, nor accept responsibility for any errors or omissions in respect of the announcing, publishing, or marking of prices, runners, times or result, in relation to the Game despite every effort to ensure their accuracy. We reserve the right to correct any obvious errors and to void any virtual bets placed as part of the Game where such have occurred.</li><li>Should virtual funds be credited to your account in error, it is your responsibility to notify us of the error without delay.</li><li>If there are any blatant errors in prices transmitted virtual bets placed as part of the Game will be settled at the correct price at the time of acceptance or the Starting Price (where applicable) whichever is the greater.</li><li>Save in the case of manifest error on our part, we accept no responsibility and shall not be liable for any consequences that are alleged to have occurred through your use, or misuse, of our services.</li><li>This Site may contain links to third party web sites.

"CORE_FORM_ADMIN_SETTINGS_PERFORMANCE_DESCRIPTION";"For very large social networks,
it may be necessary to enable caching to improve performance. If there is a noticable
decrease in performance on your social network, consider enabling caching below
(or upgrading your hardware). Caching takes some load off the database server by
storing commonly retrieved data in temporary files (file-based caching) or memcached
(memory-based caching). If you are not familiar with caching, we do not recommend
that you change any of these settings."
"CORE_FORM_ADMIN_SETTINGS_PERFORMANCE_LIFETIME_DESCRIPTION";"This determines how long
the system will keep cached data before reloading it from the database server. A
shorter cache lifetime causes greater database server CPU usage, however the data
will be more current. We recommend starting off with 60-120 seconds."
"CORE_FORM_ADMIN_SETTINGS_PERFORMANCE_TYPE_DESCRIPTION";"If you have enabled
caching above, please select the type of caching that you want to use. Memcache
caching (if available) will use memory (RAM) which is not as abundant as disk
space, however it will be faster than file-based caching when performing
read/write operations"
"CORE_FORM_ADMIN_SETTINGS_PERFORMANCE_FILE_PATH_DESCRIPTION";"This is where the
temporary files containing the cached data are stored. Folder must be writable
(chmod 777). This should be a path relative to the base directory where
SocialEngine is installed."
"CORE_FORM_ADMIN_SETTINGS_PERFORMANCE_ENABLE_DESCRIPTION";"Enable caching? Enabling
caching will decrease the CPU
usage of your database server (resulting in a decrease of page load
times). While some non-critical data may appear slightly out of date,
this will usually not be noticeable to users. For example, some of the
general site statistics on your homepage may take longer to update.
This will not be noticeable if your social network is already large and
populated with a lot of data"
